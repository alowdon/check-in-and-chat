            Within your role you may be asked to support someone who is living with poor mental health;
            1 in 4 people experience mental health problems each year and a friendly chat can help individuals
            through this difficult time. You may not be aware of an individual&rsquo;s mental health and this may not
            even be discussed during your conversation. One of the amazing things you can offer as a Check in and
            Chat volunteer is your listening skills and try to do this in a non-judgemental manner.

        <ul>
            <li>Ask questions to gather information about how the person is feeling</li>
            <li>Listen without interrupting and repeat what has been said to check you have understood.</li>
            <li>Ask open questions &ndash; What, where, when, why, how?</li>
            <li>Show someone you understand by telling them (e.g. &ldquo;I can see how that&rsquo;s been hard to deal with&rdquo;) and don&rsquo;t make judgements about what you&rsquo;re told.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You could suggest the below to promote Mental Health Wellness:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Try and stick to a routine: go to bed and wake up at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Allow time throughout the day for self-care.</li>
            <li>Try and move around and stay active, for approximately 30 minutes a day.</li>
            <li>Try and get outside for some fresh air. It&rsquo;s amazing how much fresh air can do for your spirits.</li>
            <li>Reach out to others; spend time speaking to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and eat well.</li>
        </ul>
