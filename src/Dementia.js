            Living with dementia at any time brings everyday challenges for the person and those around them. COVID-19 is
            making daily life much harder. People may feel anxious, scared or lonely. COVID-19 may mean that people affected
            by dementia are no longer able to take part in activities which supported them to live well, and their carers and
            families may be caring for them 24/7 with no respite.
        </p>

        <p>
            It&rsquo;s important to note that dementia isn&rsquo;t a natural part of ageing and similar symptoms can be brought on by
            depression. Dementia is caused by diseases of the brain and doesn&rsquo;t just cause memory problems &ndash; it can affect
            anything and everything the brain controls, including mood and changes in behaviour. Dementia can make individuals
            forget details, but they will remember the feeling of reassurance and support provided by your call. This really will
            help to stop negative feelings caused by isolation.

            If you are worried about the person you&rsquo;re supporting and their memory, or if they inform you they are struggling with
            their dementia or someone they care for with dementia, please call the Support Team. If you want more information about
            dementia, please visit <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk" target="_blank">www.alzheimers.org.uk</a>.
